# java-comparator
Application to compare two contents.

# Some considerations

I decided to assume that application will evolute and will able 
to compare another types of contents, not only JSON.

I also prepared the application decoupling the layers, 
maybe someday it will possible to simple replace some implementation or decouple 
some implementation creating new isolated services.

I tried to simulate a complex scene to exercise a little.
